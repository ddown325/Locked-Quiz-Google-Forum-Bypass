# Locked-Quiz-Google-Forum-Bypass
{[WARNING]}
If you press start on the quiz, you will screw yourself over. This also applies if you don't use the split-screen feature, as switching tabs will break the quiz, forcing you to reopen it and triggering a notification. Also, if the code opens a new tab with the locked quiz, let it load. If it doesn't open the quiz, don't press start quiz, and delete that tab, then try again. 
I AM NOT responsible if you get caught.
